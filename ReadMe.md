# Introduction
[libssh2](https://www.libssh2.org/) is a cross-platform library implementing the SSH2 protocol. **RB-libssh2** is a libssh2 [binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding) for Realbasic and Xojo ("classic" framework) projects. 

The minimum supported libssh2 version is 1.7.0. The minimum supported Xojo version is RS2010R4.

## Example
This example starts a command ("uptime") on the remote machine and reads from its StdOut stream ([**More examples**](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki#examples)): 

```realbasic
  Dim sh As SSH.Channel = SSH.OpenChannel("ssh://user:password@public.example.com/")
  Call sh.Execute("uptime")
  Dim result As String
  Do Until sh.EOF
    If sh.PollReadable() Then
      result = result + sh.Read(sh.BytesReadable, 0)
    End If
  Loop
  sh.Close
```
## Hilights
* Password, public-key, and agent-mediated [authentication](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session.SendCredentials).
* [Known host](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.KnownHosts) key verification
* Download and upload using [SFTP](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SFTP-Examples) or [SCP](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SCP-Examples).
* Manage files and directories over SFTP.
* [Execute commands](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/Process-Start-Example) on the server and read the results.
* [TCP forwarding and tunneling](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/TCP-Tunneling)
* [Stream-oriented](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SSHStream), using Xojo's built-in [Readable](http://docs.xojo.com/index.php/Readable) and [Writeable](http://docs.xojo.com/index.php/Writeable) interfaces. 
* A consistent, high-level API over the full range of libssh2's features.
* 64-bit ready
* Interact directly with libssh2 using idiomatic RB/Xojo objects, methods, and events; no shell or plugins required.

## Use of this project in GUI or Web applications
This project does not yet support being used directly in Xojo desktop or web applications (see [Issue #1](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/issues/1)). Instead, you should use this project in a console application, such as a [Xojo Worker](http://docs.xojo.com/Worker), that is invoked from your desktop or web application. 

# Synopsis
The SSH2 protocol permits an arbitrary number (up to 2<sup>32</sup>) of simultaneous [full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)) binary data streams to be efficiently and securely [multiplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) over a single TCP connection. A data stream can be an upload or download using SFTP or SCP, the input/output of a program being executed on the server, a TCP connection to a third party forwarded through the SSH server, or your own custom protocol.

For simple, one-off operations you can usually use the [Get](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Get), [Put](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Put), [Execute](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Execute), or [OpenChannel](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.OpenChannel) convenience methods in the SSH module. See also the [Connect](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Connect) convenience method if you want to perform several such operations on the same connection.

For more complex operations you will need to dig into the libssh2 API a bit more. libssh2 exposes its API through a number of different [handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_%28computing%29) types. Each libssh2 handle or handle equivalent corresponds to an object class implemented in the binding.

For more thorough documentation of individual classes and methods refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki).

|Object Class|Comment|
|-----------|-------|
|[`Session`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session)|A secure connection to the server over which one or more data streams can be multiplexed.| 
|[`Channel`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Channel)|A data stream that is multiplexed over a Session.|
|[`KnownHosts`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.KnownHosts)|A list of known hosts and their associated key fingerprints.|
|[`Agent`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Agent)|A local key management agent.|
|[`SFTPSession`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SFTPSession)|A SFTP session that is multiplexed over a Session.|
|[`SFTPStream`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SFTPStream)|A SFTP upload, download, or other operation that is performed over a SFTPSession.|
|[`SFTPDirectory`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SFTPDirectory)|A SFTP directory listing that is performed over a SFTPSession.|
|[`SCPStream`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SCPStream)|A SCP upload or download that is multiplexed over a Session.|
|[`SSHStream`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.SSHStream)|An interface which aggregates the Readable and Writeable interfaces, representing a channel or other stream.|
|[`TCPListener`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.TCPListener)|A listener for accepting forwarded TCP connections from the server.|
|[`TCPTunnel`](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.TCPTunnel)|A Channel over which a TCP connection is forwarded.|

The general order of operations is something like this:

1. Create a new instance of the `Session` class.
1. Call [Session.Connect](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session.Connect) with the address and port of the server, or a Xojo `TCPSocket` which is already connected to the server.
1. Optionally use the `KnownHosts` class to [load a list of acceptable server fingerprints](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.KnownHosts.Load), and then [compare the newly connected session's fingerprint to that list](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.KnownHosts.Lookup).
1. Call [Session.SendCredentials](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session.SendCredentials) to send the user's credentials to the server.
1. Check the [Session.IsAuthenticated](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session.IsAuthenticated) property to see if the credentials were accepted.
1. Create data streams over the session, for example the `Channel` or `SFTPSession` classes.
1. Interact with the created data streams through their [Read](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Channel.Read), [Write](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Channel.Write), etc. methods.
1. When finished with a data stream call its [Close](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Channel.Close) method.
1. After all data streams are finished and closed, call [Session.Close](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/wiki/SSH.Session.Close) to end the connection.

# How to incorporate libssh2 into your Realbasic/Xojo project
### Import the SSH module
1. Download the RB-libssh2 project either in [ZIP archive format](https://github.com/charonn0/RB-libssh2/archive/master.zip) or by cloning the repository with your Git client.
2. Open the RB-libssh2 project in REALstudio or Xojo. Open your project in a separate window.
3. Copy the `SSH` module into your project and save.

### Ensure the libssh2 shared library is installed
libssh2 is not installed by default on most systems, and will need to be installed separately (or shipped with your app). Pre-built binaries for Windows can be [downloaded from the libcurl project](https://curl.se/windows/). You will also need `libcrypto-1_1.dll` (libssh2 <= 1.9.0) or `libcrypto-3.dll` (libssh2 >= 1.10.0) from the OpenSSL project, also available from libcurl.

RB-libssh2 will raise a PlatformNotSupportedException when used if all required DLLs/SOs/DyLibs are not available at runtime.
